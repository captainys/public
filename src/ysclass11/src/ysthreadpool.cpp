/*
Initial set up:

1. Everything starts from the main thread taking readyLock.  
   The main thread locks readyLock before starting the sub-threads.

2. The main thread launches the sub-threads.

3. The main thread waits for ready signal from the sub-threads.

4. Sub-threads take taskLock.

5. Sub-threads send ready notification to the main thread.


*** First problem & solution ***
Step 5 must occur after Step 3.  If the sub-threads send ready notification before the main thread
is waiting for the notification, the notification won't be received by the main thread.

Solution => The sub-thread takes ready lock, set ready flag, and release the ready lock before 
sending the ready notification.  The sub-thread cannot take ready lock before the main thread 
releases the lock by readyWait.wait()

6. Sub-threads waits for the task notification from the main thread.



Running tasks and waiting for the completion:

7. The using program gives tasks by Run function.

8. The main thread assigns a task to a sub-thread, and send a task notification.

9. Sub-threads start running.

10. The main thread waits for the ready notification.

11. Sub-threads complete tasks and send a ready notification to the main thread.

12. Sub-threads waits for the task notification from the main thread.

*** Second problem & solution ***

Step 8 must occur after Step 6 (or Step 12).  If the sub-thread runs slower, the main thread may end up sending 
the task notification before the sub-thread start waiting.

Solution => The main thread takes the task lock before assigining a task to a sub-thread.  The task lock is 
owned by a sub-thread except while the sub-thread is waiting for the notification.  Therefore, by taking 
the task lock, the main thread can make sure that the sub-thread is waiting for a task assignment.

*** Third problem & solution ***

Step 10 must occur before Step 11.  Similar approach.  In Step 8, the main thread also changes the ready 
flag of the sub-thread to false.  It may look strange because ready flag seems to be controlled by the 
sub-thread.  However, in fact, the main thread owns the ready lock, and the ready lock can be controlled 
by whom is owning the ready lock.  The sub-thread changes the ready flag to true only when it owns the
ready lock, which is when the task is finished.

The sub-thread makes sure the main thread is waiting for the ready notification by taking the ready lock,
and then changing the ready flag from false to true.  The sub-thread can take the ready lock only while 
the main thread is waiting.  This locking guarantees that Step 11 occurs after Step 10.
